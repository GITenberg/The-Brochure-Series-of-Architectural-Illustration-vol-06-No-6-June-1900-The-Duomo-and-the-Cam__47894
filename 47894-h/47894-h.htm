<p class="p2">"It was in the middle of the thirteenth
century," writes Symonds, "during
the long struggle for independence
carried on by the republics of Lombardy
and Tuscany against the Empire and the
nobles, that some of the most durable and
splendid public works were executed. The
domes and towers of Florence and of Pisa
were rising above the city walls, while the
burghers who subscribed for their erection
were staining the waves of Meloria and the
cane-brakes of the Arbia with their blood.
Sismondi remarks with just pride, that
these great works were republican. They
were set on foot for the public use, and
were constructed at the expense of the
commonwealths. It is, however, right to
add that what the communes had begun
the princes continued. The Despots held
their power at the price of magnificence in
schemes of public utility. So much at least
of the free spirit of the communes survived
in them, that they were always rivalling
each other in great works of architecture.
Italian tyranny implied æsthetic taste and
liberality of expenditure."</p>

<p>"In the year 1294," wrote Giovanni
Villani, who was a youth in Florence at
the time, "the city of Florence being in a
state of tranquility, the citizens agreed to
rebuild the chief church, which was very
rude in form and in small proportion to
such a city, and that it should be enlarged,
and that it should be made all of marble
and with carven figures. And the foundation
was laid on the day of St. Mary, in
September, by the Cardinal Legate of the
Pope, in the presence of all the ranks of
the Signory of Florence. And it was consecrated
to the honor of God and St. Mary,
under the name of St. Mary of the Flower
(Santa Maria del Fiore). And for the
building of the church taxes were ordered,
and the Legate and bishops bestowed great
indulgences and pardons to everyone who
should contribute aid and alms to the work."</p>

<p>The design for the new cathedral was
entrusted to Arnolfo di Cambio, who was
at that time the official architect of the
Commune of Florence,&mdash;a remarkable man
to whom Florence in a great measure owes
her present physiognomy; for not only are
the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, Santa
Croce and the bulk of the Duomo his, but
Giotto's Campanile, Brunelleschi's cupola
and the church of Or San Michele are
placed where he had planned.</p>

<p>In the design for Santa Croce, Arnolfo
had shown a preference for the Gothic
forms, then newly imported into Italy, and
he now projected a design for the new
Cathedral in which the pointed should take
the place of the round arch, the stone
vaulted roof should be substituted for the
flat timber ceiling, and the façade should
form a splendid screen, adorned with gable
and pinnacle, rich with carving, glowing
with mosaics and shining with gold. That
the Florentines approved his project is
evident from a decree passed before the
work had been long in progress, in which
"Master Arnolfo" is declared to be exempt
from any civic tax during his life, because
of his design for the Cathedral, "since"
reads the Chronicle, "judging from the
magnificent and visible beginnings of the
new church, the Commune and people of
Florence are like to have a more beautiful
and honorable temple than any other in
the region of Tuscany."</p>

<p>But before the work had far advanced
the building came almost to a standstill,
for the strife of parties, which had been but
temporarily smothered, broke out anew in
Florence, and for some thirty years work
on the Cathedral was suspended. Meantime
Arnolfo had died, but he left the
building so far advanced that his successors
would find little difficulty in continuing
the main parts of the construction according
to his design.</p>

<p>In 1331, however, a portion of the communal
tax was set apart for the prosecution
of the work, and Giotto di Bondone,
already the most famous painter of all
Italy, was appointed architect of the Cathedral.
"It is not often," says Mrs. Jameson,
"that a man takes up a new trade when he
is approaching sixty, or even goes into a
new path out of his familiar routine. But
Giotto seems to have turned without a
moment's hesitation from his paints and
panels to the less easily wrought materials
of the builder and sculptor, without either
faltering from the great enterprise or
doubting his own power to do it."</p>

<p>"To his new charge," writes Mr. C. E.
Norton, "Giotto gave himself with the
effectual ardor of genius. No written
record of his work on the Duomo remains,
but the walls themselves seem to bear
witness to it. Stretches on the north and
south, running eastward from the façade,
more beautiful in composition and design
than the later work joined to it, may be
assigned with probability to the period of
his oversight.</p>

<p>"But Giotto's labor was not limited to
the Duomo alone. He now designed and
speedily began the construction of the
most exquisite building of modern times,
the one in which the quality of classic art
is most completely and beautifully harmonized
with the spirit and fancy of
modern times. The unsurpassed bell-tower
of the Duomo, known and admired by all
men as the Campanile of Giotto, is the
most splendid memorial of the arts of
Florence. In 1334, scarcely three months
after his appointment, the foundations of
the Campanile were laid with great pomp
and ceremony. The tower, so quickly
begun, was so vigorously lifted that it may
have reached somewhat more than a third
of its proposed height, when in 1337 Giotto
died." He was buried in the unfinished Cathedral
on the side nearest the Campanile.</p>

<p>"In its first appeal to the stranger's eye,"
says Mr. Ruskin in writing of the Campanile,
"there is something unpleasing; a
mingling, it seems to him, of over severity
with over minuteness. But let him give it
time, as he should all other consummate
art. I remember well how, when a boy,
I used to despise that Campanile, and
think it meanly smooth and finished. But
I have since lived beside it many a day,
and looked out upon it from my windows
by sunlight and moonlight, and I shall not
soon forget how profound and gloomy
appeared to me the savageness of the
Northern Gothic when I afterwards stood,
for the first time, beneath the front of
Salisbury. The contrast is indeed strange,
if it could be quickly felt, between the
rising of those gray walls out of their quiet
swarded space, like dark and barren rocks
out of a green lake, and that bright,
smooth, sunny surface of glowing jasper,
those spiral shafts and fairy traceries, so
white, so faint, so crystalline, that their
slight shapes are hardly traced in darkness
on the pallor of the eastern sky, that serene
height of mountain alabaster, colored like
a morning cloud and chased like a sea
shell. And this, I believe to be the model
and mirror of perfect architecture...."</p>

<p>After Giotto's death there is a wide gap
in the annals of the Duomo, for in 1348 the
great plague desolated Florence, and the
work came to a standstill. After it had
passed, however, there followed, as a
natural consequence, a sudden outbreak of
pious superstition. Immense sums had
been bequeathed by dying men to the
Church to purchase salvation; and the
Duomo, begun sixty years before, seemed
hardly to correspond with the demands of
the present age. It was accordingly resolved
to adopt a new design for it on a
grander scale than that planned by Arnolfo;
and while the breadth was to remain the
same, the height and length were to be
increased, and the eastern end of the church
to be larger. The oversight of the work
was entrusted to Francesco di Talenti, and
in 1357 the new foundations were begun.
The main forms of the new building were,
in great part, determined by such of the
old structure of Giotto's time as was left
standing, and by the original scheme of
Arnolfo. But the taste of the age had
changed, and in grafting the newly arisen
classical ideas upon the original, the architects
achieved a result which was neither
good Gothic nor good Classic. For some
years the work was now carried slowly but
steadily forward, and in 1407 the eastern
tribune with its five chapels was completed,
and the work was ready to be crowned by
a dome.</p>

<p>But here a great difficulty was encountered.
The increase in the original dimensions
and the height of the walls had
made it necessary to span an enormous
space, for the diameter of the octagon to be
covered was now one hundred and thirty-five
feet. The records of architecture
could show no such dome as this must be.
The overseers of the work were confounded,
and knew not how to proceed; and, in their
desperation made a public proclamation in
1418, that whoever wished, might make a
model for the dome, or of anything pertaining
to its construction. Fifteen models
were presented, and over them there were
months of public deliberation and discussion.
It was not until March, 1420, that a
final conclusion was reached, and the celebrated
plan of Filippo Brunelleschi was
adopted.</p>

<p>No more characteristic or remarkable
design was produced during the whole
period of the Renaissance than this, with
which its great architectural achievements
began. Not only were apparently insurmountable
difficulties of construction overcome,
but the new dome was also to be a
masterpiece of beauty. The great domes
of former times&mdash;the dome of the Pantheon,
the dome of Aya Sophia&mdash;had
been designed solely for their interior
effect; they were not impressive or noble
structures from without. But Brunelleschi
had conceived a dome which, grand in its
interior aspect, should be even more superb
from without, and which, in its stately
dimensions and proportions, in its magnificent
lift above all the other edifices of the
city of which it formed the centre, in its
absolute unity and symmetry, in the beautiful
shape and proportions of its broad
divisions, the strong, simple energy of its
upwardly converging lines, should be such
that, more than a century later, when
Michelangelo was told that he had an opportunity
to surpass it in his cupola of St.
Peter's at Rome, he replied sadly, with a
shake of his head,&mdash;</p>



<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Io farò la sorella</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Più grande già; ma non più bella!</i>"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will make her sister dome<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Larger, indeed, but not more beautiful!"<br /></span>
</div></div>



<p>Brunelleschi's plan was to build <i>two</i> octagonal
domes, separated by a space wide
enough for a passage and stairways, and
united by eight strong ribs of masonry at
the angles. The inner and smaller dome
was for constructive purposes, to bridge
the vault and to furnish a support for the
outer, which was to be merely a light shell
to secure the magnificent swelling lines.
The whole was to be crowned by a lantern.
We have not space to quote Vasari's animated
account of Brunelleschi's difficulties
in persuading the authorities of the practicability
of his plan, of his jealous bickerings
with his troublesome and incompetent
confrère, Ghiberti, of the obstacles, difficulties
and persecutions that he underwent,&mdash;suffice
it to say that, in 1434, under his
untiring supervision, just fourteen years
from its beginning, the splendid dome
closed over the central space of the Duomo,
and Brunelleschi's fame was forever established.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the completion of
the cupola and lantern, the Florentines
took advantage of the presence in their city
of Pope Eugenius IV., to have him consecrate
the Cathedral in person, with most
impressive ceremony, on the Florentine
New Year's day, the feast of the Annunciation,
March 25, 1436.</p>

<p>Not long after the consecration of the
Duomo, the work on the cupola was completed
(August, 1436), and to the fulfilment
of Brunelleschi's plan remained only the
construction of a surmounting lantern.
But for some undiscovered reason there
was delay for year after year, and it was
fated that Brunelleschi should not see the
completion of his work, for "finally," says
Vasari, "Filippo Brunelleschi being now
very old, that is sixty-nine years old in the
year 1446, on the 16th of April, went to a
better life, after having toiled greatly in
the performance of works which made him
deserve on earth an honored name, and
obtain in heaven an abode of peace." More
than twenty years passed after Brunelleschi's
death before the lantern was at last
completed. On the 23d of April, 1467, the
last and highest stone was set.</p>

<p>Meantime, not until some twenty years
after the death of Giotto had work on the
unfinished façade been recommenced. The
design for it, which was Gothic, with
columns and niches containing statues of
the Madonna and Child, of saints and
prophets, and even of distinguished Florentine
citizens, was the joint composition
of several architects, among them Orcagna,
Gaddi and Tommasi. But this façade had
only reached one-third of the height of the
edifice, when, for some unexplained reason
it was abandoned, and remained in an
unfinished state until the reign of the
Grand Duke Francis I. (1575-1587), when
it was demolished to make way for the
accomplishment of a new design, one which
was, however, never executed; and the
whole face of the Cathedral remained a
bare expanse of rubble and cement until,
in 1689, it was painted and frescoed to
represent columns and other architectural
decorations. Shortly after Tuscany was
incorporated with the kingdom of Italy,
the Florentine municipality again took up
the matter, and invited architects to submit
designs for a new façade. The design
of Commendatore de Fabris, a Florentine,
was selected. In 1875 the scaffolding was
erected, and white marble from Seravezza,
red marble from Montiere and green
marble from Prato were brought to Florence
to begin the façade which now exists,
and which was completed and unveiled in
1887.</p>

<p>Writing of the Duomo as a whole, Mr.
C. E. Norton says: "Its size gives it dignity,
and its effect is powerful from the
simplicity and largeness of its design. A
nave of four enormous bays is stopped
upon a vast octagonal space, from which,
at the east, the north, and the south, are
built out three pentagonal tribunes or
apses, which, as seen on the outside, give
to the church the common cruciform shape.
The proportions of the interior are on an
enormous scale, by which the apparent
size of the building is diminished rather
than increased. There is nothing either
in the general conception or in the working-out
of the details which corresponds
with that principle, characteristic of the
best Northern Gothic, of complex organization,
in which each minor part contributes
to the vital unity of the whole edifice.
The Duomo presents, on the contrary, an
assemblage of separate vast features arbitrarily
associated, rather than united by
any law of mutual relation into a completely
harmonious whole. It does not
display that lavish wealth of fancy in
ever-changing variety and abundance of
detail which gives inexhaustible charm to
a true Gothic edifice. But it is impressive
within from its vast open spaces, and from
the stately and simple, though barren,
grandeur of its piers and vaults and walls.</p>

<p>"The effect of the building from without
is imposing from its mass, but, in a
near view, it is only on the east that the
lines compose into forms of beauty. The
side walls are incrusted, after the old
Tuscan style, with simple rectangular patterns
of white and red marble, interrupted
by the rich decoration of gable and pinnacle
over the doors and windows.</p>

<p>"It is when seen from a distance that the
full worth and power of the great Cathedral
force themselves upon the beholder.
Looking down upon Florence from one of
the neighboring heights, the beautiful city
seems to lie gathered under the shelter of
its mighty Duomo. The stretch of its wall
is ample for the house in which the whole
people shall gather, and, lifting itself
above the clustering towers and belfries of
palaces and churches, the unrivalled dome
crowns the edifice, and with its noble
elliptic lines not merely concentrates the
scattered forms of the buildings beneath
and around it far and near, but to the
inward eye seems equally to concentrate
all the divergent energies of the historic
life of Florence, and lift them along its
curves to the foot of the cross upon its
heaven-reaching summit. It seems of equal
date with the mountains that close the
background to the landscape of which it
forms the central interest; and they seem
to look down upon this work of man as one
not unworthy of their guardianship."</p>

<p class="p2">The representation of physical beauty
being with the Gothic carver subordinated
to the purpose of enforcing
the idea that the soul is superior to the
body, and of illustrating the doctrine of
the salvation of the soul by goodness of
life, and the loss of the soul by evil life, it
was necessary that beings and objects not
beautiful should enter into his sculptured
ornamental schemes. The evils that beset
the lives and tempt the souls of men had
to be in some way set forth, no less than
the human virtues and the heavenly ideals.
The unhappy lot of the wicked had to be
figured as well as the felicities of the good.
Hence figures which embody the mediæval
notions of the monstrous and the grotesque
are conspicuous elements in Gothic sculpture,
especially after the beginning of the
thirteenth century. The grotesque, in the
finest Gothic art, while often apparently
introduced in a playful spirit, had thus
primarily a serious purpose.</p>

<p>The Romanesque imagery, consisting of
fantastic creations of animal life which embodied
distorted traditions of the Roman
mythology, combined with forms originating
in the rude imagination of the Northern
races, was largely rejected by the early
Gothic artists. The imaginary creatures
which they sometimes introduced were,
for the most part, confined to the symbolic
animals of the Bible&mdash;such as those seen
by St. John in the Apocalypse. But by
degrees other imaginary creations were
introduced, until finally, during the thirteenth
century, the grotesque animal life
of the Gothic edifice became even more extended
in range than that of the richest
Romanesque monuments had been, and
an imaginary fauna was created, which,
while it derived much from the older conceptions,
embodied so much that was new
as to constitute a distinctly Gothic class.
This development grew primarily out of
the old popular belief in the symbolic character
of animals and imaginary creatures.
As symbols of human qualities, both good
and evil, these animals, real and imaginary,
were now wrought, for encouragement and
for warning, upon the stones of the sacred
edifice. A further purpose of this fauna,
as of the sculpture of the human figure and
the flora with which it was associated,
apparently was that the Gothic monument
might present a compendious illustration
of the known world of creation, imagination
and faith.</p>

<p>A remarkable quality of the grotesque
creations of Gothic art is the close and accurate
observation of nature which they,
no less than the images of real things, display.
However fabulous the imagined
creature may be, the materials out of which
he is made are derived from nature, and
manifest a keen appreciation of animal
structure. Vertebra or claw, wing or beak,
eye or nostril, throat or paw,&mdash;every anatomical
member displays an intimate familiarity
with real organic form and function,
and an imaginative sense of its possible
combinations in creative design. Take,
for instance, those strange beasts, or terrible
demons of the parapet of the Cathedral
of Paris. Each of them seems animated
with a living spirit, and has an almost
startling appearance of reality. And besides
this lifelikeness and functional truth, a
highly ornamental play of lines, and a subtle
elaboration of finely modelled surfaces, are
shown in these grotesque forms. In the
early and early mature periods they exhibit
a noticeable restraint of posture and movement;
extravagantly contorted forms and
violent movements occur, for the most part,
only in the decline of Gothic, when jaded
sensibilities had ceased to appreciate the
value of moderation in design.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles
H. Moore</span>: "<i>Gothic Architecture</i>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to Notre Dame at Paris, the
churches of Rheims, Amiens, Rouen, Laon,
Vézelay, Auxerre and the religious edifices
throughout Poitou, Saintonge, Guyenne
and Burgundy, and the borders of the
Loire, in France are rich in examples of
grotesque animal sculpture.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
